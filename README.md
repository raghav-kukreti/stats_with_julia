# Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning with Julia

Julia seems like a cool language to work with and manipulate data. All the code in the repo is written from scratch using [The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) as a reference.

I hope this becomes a good resource for anyone trying their hands with Julia.
